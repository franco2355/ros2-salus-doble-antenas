# Local RViz launcher for the real global-nav v2 stack.
#
# This script is meant to be run on the operator PC, not on the Raspberry Pi.
# The robot is expected to already be running `real_global_v2.launch.py`
# headless, while this helper starts only RViz inside the local Docker
# workspace so the PC can attach to the live ROS 2 graph over DDS.
#
# It does not launch sensors, controllers, or navigation on the robot.
# It only opens the RViz profile for `real_global_v2`.
#
# Cyclone DDS and ROS_DOMAIN_ID are exported explicitly because that is the
# middleware/domain currently used to join the robot's ROS 2 graph from the
# local workstation.
